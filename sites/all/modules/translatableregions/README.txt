translatableregions adds the ability for the user to machine-translate
specific regions which you specify as CSS selectors.

Installation
------------

The 2.x-dev version of the jquery_update module is currently required for
IE8 support. Get it at http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update.

Copy the translatableregions folder to your sites/all/modules directory, 
then enable it at Administer > Site Building > Modules.

Configure the CSS selectors for the regions that you want to work with at 
Administer->Site Configuration->Translatable Regions.
